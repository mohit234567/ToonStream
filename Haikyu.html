    <p class="info">Hinata Shouyou, a short middle school student, gained a sudden love of volleyball after watching a national championship match on TV. Determined to become like the championship's star player, a short boy nicknamed "the small giant", Shouyou joined
        his school's volleyball club. Unfortunately, he was the only member and the club didn't have so much as a place to practice. He didn't let that deter him, however, and, upon finally acquiring 5 other players in his final year, was able to compete
        in an actual competition - only for his team to be unlucky enough to face the championship favorite and its star player, Kageyama Tobio, called "the king of the court", in the first round.
