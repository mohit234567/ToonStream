    <p class="info">Shinnosuke Nohara, A.K.A. Shin-chan, a combination of Dennis The Menace and Howard Stern, is a 5-year-old growing up in Kasukabe in this animated series. His foul mouth and rude behavior constantly scandalize his parents (although his father seems
        to be a big influence), his teacher, and everyone else with the bad luck to cross his path. Later in the series Shin-chan gains a baby sister, who seems well on the way to following in his footsteps.</p>
