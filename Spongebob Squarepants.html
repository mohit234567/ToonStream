    <h1>SpongeBob SquarePants</h1>
    <img src="images/sponge.jpeg" alt="toy" class="toy">
    <p class="info">The character-driven cartoon chronicles the nautical and often nonsensical adventures of SpongeBob, an incurably optimistic and earnest sea sponge, and his underwater friends. Dwelling a few fathoms beneath the tropical isle of Bikini Atoll in the
        subsurface city of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob lives in a two-story pineapple. Instead of taking the logical approach to everyday challenges, SpongeBob approaches life in a wayward and unconventional way. Whether searching for the ultimate spatula
        to perfect his burger flipping technique at the Krusty Krab or just hanging out with his best friend Patrick) destination turns out to be suffering a monster problem, and the gang volunteers to investigate the case.
